 [Do OS abstractions make sense on FPGAs?](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi20/presentation/roscoe)



FPGA as the hardware accelerators specially designed for certain tasks.

FPGA is more like a micro-computer with everything (e.g. RAM).

**The related work section of this work is** **pretty good** - many previous work improve the primitives of FPGA programming.

Like kernel space and user space isolation design.


Some background knowledge related to FPGA which matters most.

For performance, you still need to choose when to offload computation to FPGA - for good reasons.

Portability achieved by (Section 3.3)

- Laguange features

- Address translation - can be translated by the OS during the execution.

- Some other functionalities achievable by the OS.

Why it's hard to achieve multiplexing - NO hardware interrupt. 

FPGA logic may be **reconfigured**.

Processes as isolated circuits (vFPGA) at runtime.

FPGA is IO-rich, more than simply computations. (Different compared to GPUs).

The design of the generic user logic interface, just like ABIs. These calls are achiveable by [AXI4](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0051/a/Introduction/About-the-AXI4-Stream-protocol) streaming protocol.

CPUs submit both compuation and environment to the vFPGAs. If

**Previous can only have run-to-completion scheduling. Because FPGA is not preemptive.** (kind of hard to believe.)

This is still important if you want to have FPGAs on the cloud. Even though coyote's approach is one small step forward though...

- Pointer swizzling is like previous approaches that change pointers to relative distances...

- They don't like IOMMUs because they are fixed sizes.
- Coyote incorporate the DDR4 on FPGA to dirrectly map that to the address to the CPUs - but this is not coherent though (require driver code to implement cache coherent algorithms.)
- A two-tier TLB, one for large page, one for small page.

Not everything is satisfying, but at least thumbs up for many aspects.





# Evaluation 

**Quick takeways.**

- The design is kind of making sense but with certain overhead.

- The argument is that main overhead is the space. The underlying point is that FPGA is not built to share, only one job at a time. So you may have more space though.


- context switch is the reconfiguration time.
- Minimizing the number of reconfigurations (context switches) is the key to scheduling .



**Open question:** We try to make FPGA like standard server, but is this the right thing to do?
